About the reddit sorting folder

When I get new Reddit media in, I use this sorting folder to copy and move content around.
The sorting processs goes like this:

* Phone backup system (Imperial Google Drive system):

1. Download phone backup
2. Copy all Reddit media (videos, images) to the sorting folder
3. Go folder through folder, cutting NSFW and SFW images, and putting the into the correct folders
4. Copy all SFW reddit media to !Backups, SFW+NSFW(all)
5. Cut all SFW reddit media to SFW
6. Copy all NSFW reddit media to !Backups, SFW+NSFW(all)
7. Cut all NSFW reddit media to NSFW

* Modern  process (OneDrive, OneDrive)

1. Download reddit backups
2. Copy all reddit media (videos, images) to the sorting folder
3. Copy all SFW reddit media to !Backups, SFW+NSFW(all)
4. Cut all SFW reddit media to SFW
5. Copy all NSFW reddit media to !Backups, SFW+NSFW(all)
6. Cut all NSFW reddit media to NSFW

Permanent directories used:

DIR: SFW
DIR: NSFW
